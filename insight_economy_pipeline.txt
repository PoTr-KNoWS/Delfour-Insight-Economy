=== ANSWER — RUNTIME PREVIEW (device banner) ===
{
  "headline": "Track sugar per serving while you scan",
  "product_name": "Classic Tea Biscuits",
  "note": "High sugar",
  "suggested_alternative": "Low-Sugar Tea Biscuits"
}

=== REASON WHY (private) ===
Household requires low-sugar guidance (diabetes in POD). You are starting a self-scanner session at Delfour right now. Envelope is minimized and limited to this session.
